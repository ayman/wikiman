Grab a wikipedia page and display it as a manpage.  This app currently adds "_(Unix)" to disambiguate the *nix command in the wikipedia.  Wiki formatting is converted to nroff manpage format which can be seen as a manpage via:

% python wikiman.py ls | nroff -man | less

or you can use the shell script:

% chmod 755 wikiman
% ./wikiman cut

if you are adventurous, you can issue the call to fetch raw/non-unix pages:

% python wikiman.py -r macintosh | nroff -man | less 
% python wikiman.py --raw macintosh | nroff -man | less 

You will need python 2.6 for the JSON call to work.

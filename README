Grab a wikipedia page and display it as a manpage.  This app currently adds "_(Unix)" to disambiguate the *nix command in the wikipedia.  Wiki formatting is converted to nroff manpage format which can be seen as a manpage via:

% python wikiman.py ls | nroff -man | less

You will need python 2.6 for the JSON to work
